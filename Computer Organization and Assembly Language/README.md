Typing Speed Test

OVERVIEW

The aim of this project is to create a program that will calculate the typing speed of a user and display it on the console screen.

GOALS

1.	Calculate the Typing Speed of the user  ( words/min )
2.	Display a summary of the incorrectly typed words 
3.	Also identify the key(s) pressed when typing a word incorrectly 

SPECIFICATIONS

The program randomly generates a paragraph on the console. The user is asked to type the given paragraph as it is on the console.  A clock keeps track of the time elapsed when the ENTER key is pressed. The program then stores the typed text into a string and performs a comparison on it to check for any errors. This process continues for an indefinite period of time after which the userâ€™s typing speed (words/min) as well as a summary of his/her incorrectly typed words are displayed on the output screen.
